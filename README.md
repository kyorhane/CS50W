# Tracking my progress with CS50's Web Track
## Project 2: Commerce

- Repeating duplicate codes all over the place (templates, views),
- poorly-designed relational databases (models),
- unintuitive objects (queryset),
- forms and server-side validation (clean),
- bad urlconf leading to spaghetti codes, error-prone index accessing (redirect, reverse, re.path),
- horrible naming skill (CamelCase 🐫, snake_case 🐍, explicity, simplicity, consistency)
